# Process-Mining-using-R-packages-on-Insurance-data
The data used for this demo is synthetic. The data points are engineered to 
allow users to visualise bottlenecks, deviations from the standard process and 
information flow. 

Process Mining package - bupaR
An open-source suite for the handling and analysis of business process data in
